\title{
Addon batch effect adjustment for standardization
}
\description{
Performs addon batch effect adjustment for standardization: 
1) takes the output of \code{\link{standardize}} applied to a training 
data set together with new batch data; 
2) checks whether the training data was also adjusted using standardization and whether the same number of variables is present in training and new data;
3) performs standardization on the new batch data.
}
\usage{
standardizeaddon(params, x, batch)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{params}{
object of class \code{standardize}.
}
  \item{x}{
matrix. The covariate matrix of the new data. Observations in rows, variables in columns.
}
  \item{batch}{
factor. Batch variable of the new data. Currently has to have levels: '1', '2', '3' and so on.
}
}

\value{
The adjusted covariate matrix of the test data.

\note{
It is \bold{not recommended} to perform standardization in cross-study prediction settings, because for some classifiers the prediction performance can be strongly impaired by this method. Given a not too small test set, the following methods are recommended (Hornung et al., 2016a): \code{\link{combatba}}, \code{\link{meancenter}}, \code{\link{ratioa}}, \code{\link{ratiog}}.

Because standardization is performed "batch by batch" the "addon procedure" for standardization consists of plain standardization on the new test batches.
